Overall Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Client instantiates itself
Client connects to broker, gets messages, converts them from JSON to objects,
    which are added to state.messages
Certain actions generate status messages, such as connecting to broker, joining a channel, disconnecting.


Main window
~~~~~~~~~~~
  * Class - Contains state

  * Contains methods that manage state
    * onChange
      * Gets event.target.value and stores it in state.text
    * onSubmit
      * Prevent default
      * Verifies that state.text isn't zero length
      * If verification passes, generates and publishes a JSON
        representation of a SingleMessage

  * Contains mqtt client implementation
    * Right now, the client is a serious of methods attached to MainWindow.  I think I should switch it
      to be a separate class that gains access the the setState, instance variables, etc, by having
      MainWindow passed as a argument to the client generation function.

    * Methods used:
        * onConnect
          * Adds status message to this.state.messages
        * onSubscribe
          * Adds status message to this.state.messages
        * onMessage
          * Converts Buffer object to string, then to JSON, handling errors
          * Converts JSON object to SingleMessage, appends to this.state.messages,
            which re-renders the messageWindow list of messages

  * Contains render method.
    * Render flow control:
      * Messages is an array of objects, each representing a message, meaning they have:
        * Username
        * Timestamp
        * Payload
        * messageID
      props
      The render maps across the array of messages, and in that map call, individual status messages
      are detected and rendered as StatusMessages, rather than SingleMessages

Single message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  * SFC
  * Used by main window
  * Does no validation
  * Deconstructs props into instance variables:
      * Username
      * Timestamp
        * is a float, rendered into a string representation
      * Payload
      * messageID



Chat Input
~~~~~~~~~~
  * SFC
  * Takes input,
  * Uses MainWindow.onChange and MainWindow.onSubmit, passed as props
  * Does no validation, that's handled by MainWindow.onSubmit
